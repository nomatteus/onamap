Stuff... on a map!
==================

Get Started
-----------

Two easy steps:

1. `git clone git@github.com:nomatteus/onamap.git`
2. Open index.html in your web browser!

You should be able to run this directly in your browser (i.e.
"double-click" on it!), but you'll probably want to run this through a
web server once the _real coding_ starts.

See the [Google Maps JavaScript API V3
docs](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/) for
examples, API documentation, and tutorials.

Files
-----

`css/style.css`

Very basic styles to fill the browser window with the map.

`js/app.js`

Creates the map, and contains events to add markers on click. 
Start coding here!

`index.html`

Loads the Google Maps JS, and HTML for the map/controls/etc.

About
-----

A framework to allow rapid development of sites that feature "things" on a map.

I am genericizing the code from my "streetcars on a map" site:
